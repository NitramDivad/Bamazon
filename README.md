Bamazon App

Bamazon is an "Amazon.com" like storefront which utilizes both Node.JS and MySQL.

Bamazon contains three (3) essential functional areas as follows:

    * 'Customer'
        * The Customer is presented with a list of available items to purchase
        * Once an item is selected, the Customer is asked for the quantity to purchase
        * After Quantity entry, the purchase is finalized and the Customer is provided the total charge
        * The stock_quantity and the product_sales data columns are both updated in the products table
        * The Customer is given the opportunity to continue shopping or to Quit

    * 'Manager'
        * The Manager will have the following five options:
            - View Products for Sale
            - View Low Inventory
            - Add to Inventory
            - Add New Product
            - Quit Program
        * View Products for Sale will list every available item by ID, name, price and quantity
        * View Low Inventory lists all items with an inventory count lower than five
        * Add to Inventory allows the Manager to add items to the existing inventory count for an item
        * Add New Product allows the Manager to add a new product to the Bamazon store
        * The products table will be appropriately updated with each of the above functions

    * 'Supervisor'
        * The Supervisor will have the following three options:
            - View Product Sales by Department
            - Create New Department
            - Quit Program
        * View Product Sales will display a summarized table which will include the Department ID, Name, Overhead Costs, Total Sales, and Profit
        * Total Sales and Profit are calculated for display purposes and are not stored on the database

    * The table structure for both the products and the departments table can be found in their 
      respective SQL files.  Each does contain initialization data.

    * A Guide for use is also included.  It can be found at the link below.
